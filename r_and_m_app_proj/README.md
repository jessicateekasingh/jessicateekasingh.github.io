# Rick and Morty Status Finder

Live site: https://jessicateekasingh.github.io/r_and_m_app_proj/


Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API


Approach: The approach I took for this project was to create a simple and straight to the point app that would essentially display the information of the current status of the character they click on. The status will show the health(status), location, and name!

Unsolved problems: I would have preferred to fix some functionality in terms of the CSS and where certain elements display on the screen. I want to display the image URL of the location key from the API, but it would have required some extra coding that I did not have the time for once I reached that area.
